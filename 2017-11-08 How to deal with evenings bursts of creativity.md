I am just a regular guy, software dev. Working on normal hours like 8 - 16. Sometimes I play football or go jogging with friends on late evenings, to have any kind of physical activity during the day. After that I feel my muscles are aching and I feel very tired, but with high oxidation my brain starts working on high revs.

To go to sleep, I try to cheat myself with small dose of video games or having a beer. But there are some nights when, after I lie down in bed, even that does not work for me. I am experiencing this `flow of creativity` and cannot fall asleep. Many new project, articles, problem solving ideas don't stop comming whilst I am just trying to sleeeeeep. It is important, because next day in the morning I will be like a zombie in the office and my productivity will be like zero.

How do you deal with it? After all, I know I could end up with starting workout before working hours, but I do not want to wake up so early :D

P.S.
It would be good to have a Harry's Potter Pensieve, to be able to rewind everything and start a new day with clear mind :)
