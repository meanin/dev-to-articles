Everyone wants to extend their knowledge of favourite technology. I am going to be a full stack dev in the future. Backend frameworks are quite well understood by me already. Things like ASP.NET MVC or .NET Core. Database connection covered by EF6. A little about azure components - app services, web jobs, etc. Now I am learning about js basics and I want to know what should I focus on later?
