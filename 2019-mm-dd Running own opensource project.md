I always wanted to start an opensource project. A year ago or so, I was trying, with a few friends to write a portal to rate a craft beer. Available apps like this are more than many, but this supposed to be a way to learn something more. As it always turns out, none besides me didn't have time to focus on a project. Within 3-5 weeks we abandon the whole idea. I started to have a doubt if there is any sense to work in that way in my off hours.

# Change

After I change my job, I started to have more challenging tasks. Few of them, make me create a PoC project, which I put on my [github](https://github.com/meanin). With time passing, I come back to writing on dev.to. In that time I create a [project](https://github.com/meanin/vsts-tasks) to support CI/CD processes on an Azure DevOps, also documented on this portal :). And then it comes to me - Let give it a try, again. So, I asked myself, is there anything which will help me in regular work, which I am missing? Recently, I started driving technical interviews. I was doing this by filling some excel files. It was annoying, ineffective etc. And that's how I found my idea for an opensource project.

# Technology

I am mainly backend .net developer. I know something about Azure Cloud. It was obvious that my project will be based on that technology. A cloud-based, web application which supports technical interviews. Ok, I decided about the backend, but it will need some frontend as well. There are plenty of that kind frameworks. Should I use React? Or Angular? Or some other? Naaaaaah. Dotnet rocks, right? Recently, I found an article about a .net SPA framework. I dig in for that. It is currently an unsupported experimental web framework, but hey, it is dotnet and this will be something that I want to work with. The framework is called [Blazor](https://blazor.net/). As the docs say: `Browser + Razor = Blazor`!

# Get the fellows on board

I didn't have any expectation this time. I did not want to force anybody to contribute. I started this alone and made a few first steps, to get a scaffolded app working. I created a repository on a GitHub, downloaded mentioned framework and started learning. Few friends follow me on a GitHub. They started to ask about a project because they also heard something about this framework and want to learn it from a scratch. 

After some time I was looking at new GitHub features. One of them is the project board. It helps organize work for a project. I created a `project` to get know how it works. It looks like a kanban board. I guess that we can use it as a scrum board for a single sprint. So I created one. Filled it with GitHub issues which describes what I want to achieve with a project.

When tasks (`issues`) arrived, I asked my friends if they want to help. Currently, we are getting really close to version 1.0 of our app. They are happy to participate. They have done some tasks, some I have done. It is really going in the right direction.

* How do you start your opensource projects? 
* Do you use GitHub's project board?
* How to organize a project on GitHub differently?
